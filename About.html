         Today, there is hardly anyone in the world who does not know about Uber’s prevalent business model and its success story.<br> 
         Similarly, Zomato is one of the successful on-demand food delivery platforms that helps users discover food places and get it delivered at their doorstep.<br>
          Now you must be wondering why Zomato earns huge profits only by delivering food. Let’s dig into details of how zomato works and how it has gained huge momentum in recent years.</p></b><br>
          <br>
          <p>More and more business owners are jumping into the online food delivery system bandwagon as it saves the user’s time and effort.<br>
             You must be shocked to know that, but the online food delivery market is growing at an annual growth rate of 15.4 % by the year-end 2025.</p>

             <h1>What is Zamato</h1>
             <p>Zomato is one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly apps where people can search for nearby restaurants and cafés, order food online, and get it delivered at their doorstep in no time.<br>
                 Moreover, you can also get accurate information about restaurants as it provides menus, reviews, and ratings. Based on that, users can place orders and enjoy lip-smacking food at their homes.</p><br>
                 <h2>Zomato Foundation: Success Story Behind The Idea</h2><br>
                 <p>Zomato was founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah, two Delhi IIT, in 2008. Till November 2010, Zomato was known as “Foodiebay.” <br>
                    Once they saw their colleagues who were seeking menus of different restaurants to order food.<br>
                     That’s when the idea took birth, and they thought of converting these manual menus into a digital format.<br>
                      In the year 2012, Zomato had spread its wings across the globe and started to list out the number of restaurants in the market.<br> Before UrbanSpoon took entry into the market, Zomato has made its feet strong and is now present in 22 countries with more than one million restaurants globally and receives 1.25 million orders daily.<br>
                       Zomato is also having an enthusiastic team of food soldiers who visit each restaurant and assure them that their data is secured. <br>
                       Users can share reviews, give their opinions, and enable users to create stories based on their food experience. This initiative makes Zomato more social.<br>
                        Zomato’s user-friendly app is one of the reasons why people prefer to order food online. More than 1 million users across 22 countries, including Australia and New Zealand.<br>
                         Now using their mobile device to order food, Zomato enables them to get a meal at their location without any trouble.</p>
